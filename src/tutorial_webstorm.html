      <h2 id="webstorm_afs">WebStorm to AFS Setup</h2>
      <p>
        To setup AFS auto-upload, click the menu item Tools > Deployment > Configuration. Next, click the plus icon at
        the top left to add a new remote host and select SFTP. Enter in configuration information (Host, Username,
        Authentication, Root Path, and Web Server URL). Under the “Mappings” tab, you can also set more specific paths
        for deployment. After all that, all you have to do is select your remote host from the menu item Tools >
        Deployment > Automatic Upload and any saved changes will be automatically uploaded onto the remote server.</p>

      <h2 id="webstorm_files">WebStorm Local File Creation</h2>
      <p>
        To create files and folders in WebStorm, first you’ll need a project (this can be created by the menu item > New
        > Project File). Right click the project folder or any folder within the project folder and click New, from
        there select either “File” or any of the other preestablished file types based on the type of file you’d like to
        create.

      </p>

      <h2 id="afs_files">AFS File Creation</h2>
      <p>
        To create a file via AFS, login and navigate to the respective folder using the terminal (refer to AFS and
        Terminal below). Now all you have to do is run the command “mkdir DIRECTORY_NAME” replacing DIRECTORY_NAME with
        the desired directory name if you want to create a directory in the given folder; or run the command “touch
        FILENAME” replacing FILENAME with the desired file name (and file extension) to create a file.

      </p>

      <h2 id="html5_boilerplate">HTML5 Boilerplate and Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        First, download or clone a copy of the HTML5 Boilerplate. Also, make sure to have an installation of node.js on
        your desktop. Next, run WebStorn with the copy of the HTML5 Boilerplate as the project folder. Then, run a
        terminal session (clicking the terminal tab at the bottom) and run the command “npm install” to download
        dependencies and generate a “node_modules” folder. Then, run the command “npm install -g gulp” to install gulp
        within the project. Now any further work should be done within the “src” folder. After you’re done, you can run
        the command “npm run build” to build the project and check the results under the “dist” folder. When deploying
        your website, place the contents of the “dist” folder onto the web server (as it’s representative of the root
        folder).

      </p>

      <h2 id="afs_terminal">AFS and Terminal</h2>
      <p>
        When accessing your site via AFS you are going to need to know what your domain is. Go to tools > deployment >
        configuration. When in Configuration take note of the web server url. This url is going to be where your site is
        hosted. You are also going to need to know the directory. To find the path, go to the same window via tools >
        deployment > configuration and go to mapping. The mapping will show you where your file is hosted on the AFS.
        Some useful linux commands to know are:
        copy – cp SOURCE_FILE_PATH DESTINATION_FOLDER_PATH
        Move – mv SOURCE_FILE_PATH DESTINATION_FOLDER_PATH
        Rename – ren SOURCE_FILE_PATH NEW_FILENAME
        These commands can be used, once logged into the terminal, to move and configure your directory.
