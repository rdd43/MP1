      <h2>Repository Creation</h2>
      <p>
        To begin, either create a new remote repository on GitHub or find an existing one. In either case, copy the URL of the remote repository.
        Next, startup a git bash terminal session (in WebStorm, click the terminal tab at the bottom) inside a local folder that’ll act as your local repository.
        Finally, run the command “git clone REMOTE_URL,” replacing REMOTE_URL with the one you obtained earlier. If you’d like to instead just create a local repository,
        skip the first step and run the command “git init” to initialize a local git repository. You’ll need to later “git remote add REMOTE_URL” a remote repository if you wish.
      </p>

      <h2>Making Commits in WebStorm</h2>
      <p>
        First, files must be added onto the “staging area” before file changes can be committed. To check whether any file changes aren’t part of the staging area,
        run the command “git status” (this will of course disregard files in the gitignore file). In WebStorm, in order to add files and make a commit,
        go the top menu > VCS > Git (here you’ll find other git command shortcuts). Clicking “Add” will add respective files onto the staging area; however,
        “Commit File” will also give you the option to add any files to the staging area, followed by making the commit to the repository.
        Note: commits, as well as other git commands, can be ran in the WebStorm terminal, which can be found as a tab in the bottom of a project
      </p>

      <h2>Making Branches</h2>
      <p>
        To make a new branch, run a git bash terminal session (in WebStorm, click the terminal tab at the bottom) within a local repository. Next,
        run the command “git branch BRANCH_NAME” to create a new branch of BRANCH_NAME. Other useful commands include “git branch” to get a list of
        branches in the local repository and “git branch -d BRANCH_NAME” to delete a branch in the local repository.
